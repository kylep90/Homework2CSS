# Homework 2

Homework 2 was to create linked html pages using BootStrap. That have responsive screens and I believe I have completed all the required functions.

`index.html`
* Linked to CSS file, Bootstrap CSS and GoogleFonts.

* Main - created class <card-text> (line 53) in order to modify the element using the ideal text size, spacing and line height.

* Created images that had links to my social media

* <Question - Is there an easier way to create these links?>


`portfolio.html`
* As well as the files linked in the index.html, I also linked BootStrap CSS in order for the carousel to function.

* I originally had the carousel auto fit the page length, however this made the images look ugly therefore defined the images to a certain size in the CSS.

* I creasted class <text-background> (line 70) in order for the text to be read clearly.

`contact.html`
* Same stylesheets linked as in the index.html.

* Use a Form setting from Bootstrap and separately added a Submit button.

*<Question - My submit button doesn't actually do anything right now, how would you make it submit and save the information that the user inputs?>

`style.css`
* I have added cursor properties in line 23 and 83. This either changed the colour of text or the transparency of the image.

* I added a height of 73vh (viewer height) to both the card class in order to make it fit the size of the screen. This is something new that I leant.

* <Question - Why is it when I made it 100vh, i still had a scroll bar show?>

* I added a media-querey to change the size of the carousel and the footer on the index.html in order to see the social media icons. I believe this could be done better

* I have used positioning in order to make a sticky footer as what was asked in the Bonus activities.

## General Comments
I think I have done well on this homework. I'm not 100% if I have fully understood the media query, but I believe my pages update according to size.

If I had to redo this activity again I would try to make my background more colourful.
